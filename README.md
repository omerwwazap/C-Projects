# C Notes & Project
---

### GLUT Projects
The projects I made for the CTIS 164 - Technical Mathematics with Programming course.

I normally don't like putting everything into a single file, however this was a requirement of the course. 

They wanted us to send a single .cpp file only for each project.

### I have no remembrance of these projects it's been years since i did them. Will check them and than modify the readme
